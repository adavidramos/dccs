As a way for our members to get to know us better, DCCS will be featuring a runner spotlight each week on our blog. Are you interested in being featured for an upcoming spotlight? E-mail Patty at marketing@dccapitalstriders.com and we will reach out to you quickly!

Our first feature is of Sam Stout, DCCS Board Member, Run Group Leader and all around great guy! While he is not too chatty, you can see his sense of humor ring through his responses- just one of the reasons why his run groups like him so much.

1. How long have you been running?
Less than 2 years.

2. How did you get into running?
I realized that my father was in much better shape than me, and he's pushing 70.

3. In how many races have you competed?
A couple 5ks, a 10k, and two half-marathons.

4. What is your favorite pre-run fuel/ post run snack?
I ate leftover Indian food at 3 AM before my last half-marathon.  It worked out great!  Post-run, I'll eat anything and everything with no shame.

5. What is the most embarrassing thing to you happen to you in the middle of a run?
My ID and credit cards fell out of my phone running sleeve in the middle of a 5k.  I had to turn back against the crowd to get them... it was horrible.

6. What DCCS runs do your frequent?
Dupont Circle Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6:30 PM, and Saturdays at 9:00 AM.

7. Do you like running buddies or do you prefer to run alone?
Running alone is no fun!  Gotta have a good group to run with.

8. What is your must-have object on a run?
My phone!  Gotta log that distance.

9. What's your favorite running outfit?
Nike DryFit stuff.  It's great.

10. Do you have a favorite place to run? (Can be a city, trail, etc.)
The Mall is amazing.  Love running there.

11. What is the worst race in which you have participated? (can be "the worst" for any reason)
I barely trained or even ran for my first half-marathon.  It almost killed me.  

12. What is your favorite race distance and why?
5ks.  I'm built for speed.

13. How many times a week do you typically run?
Five times a week -training for the rock'n'roll half in March.

14. How has running or your feelings towards running changed over the years?
I think I become more addicted to it every year.  

15. Do you have a certain race or distance that you hope to accomplish one day?
I'd like to run a full marathon this fall, but I've got a long way to go. 

16. Do you have any race day superstitions? Does getting really nervous count?  

17. What or who inspires you to run?
Achieving PRs is great.  There's nothing better.

18. What is your favorite running memorabilia and why?
I keep my race bibs and medals in a big pile.  

19. How has running changed or contributed to the person you are?
Running is a great outlet for stress.  That s**t will calm you down.

20. Why do you volunteer with DCCS?
'Cause it's surprisingly fun!
