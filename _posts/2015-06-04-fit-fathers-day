On Sunday, June 21, families and friends are invited to attend the 2nd annual Fit Fathers Day Celebration, held from 10 AM to 12 PM in Downtown Silver Spring, MD. There will be fitness contests, live entertainment, gift bags, prizes from companies like Soul Cycle and City Sports, demonstrations, music by DJ Blinks and a fitness course challenge that will warrant a $500 Grand Prize.
 
In attendance will be celebrity trainer Michael Bance and Fit Fathers founder Kimatni D. Rawlins, who will be leading a “Social Workout.” Rawlins founded Fit Fathers to inspire other men to be a living example for eating healthy and exercising in order to enhance their lives and the lives of their loved ones. Rawlins himself is extremely active, having competed in running distances from 5Ks to half-marathons. He also practices boxing and yoga and follows a vegan diet in efforts to eat well and stay active.
 
The DC Capital Striders are proud to partner with Fit Fathers for this year’s celebration. Join us as we help share Fit Fathers’ positive message for fathers and families everywhere: “Empowering role models, father figures, families and children!”
