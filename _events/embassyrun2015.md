One weekend a year, the European embassies open their doors for tours, food, and fun cultural experiences, but long lines often pose a problem. Luckily, we'll get to skip said lines at a total of ten European embassies over the course of our run. Due to popular demand, we'll have two groups running two different routes this year - one group will run eight miles, while the other will run ten. We'll spend about fifteen to thirty minutes at each embassy, so there will be plenty of opportunities for rest breaks. A photographer will even tag along and take some pictures for the May issue of Runner's World!

Runners will also receive a special Embassy Run technical shirt as well as an invitation to a catered reception at Lebanese Taverna on April 30th.

Tickets are currently $40.00, and the proceeds will be donated to We Are Family DC. If you can't make the run, you can still join us at Lebanese Taverna for $15 or grab a cool tech shirt for $15 as well.

Register and pay on the [EU Embassy Run website](http://euembassyrun.com/) (be sure to do both!)
